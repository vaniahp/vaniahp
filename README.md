### About
Hello everyone,
Thank you for visiting my page and it's a pleasure to see you here.
My name is Vania and now I'm a student of Geophysics at Gadjah Mada University. Since little, I have been interested in how the earth works, and now it develops into curiosity about how the earth processes the gas, petroleoum and geothermal. But beside that, I also put my attention on social issues that are constantly changing in every era.
